# House Marketplace App Created with React.js

This project was created in order to showcase my learning of React. I am enrolled in a Udemy coure (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) in order to ensure my basic knowledge of React developement is fully up to date. I plan on uploading my 4 projects made following the course here, as well as several public project I will create on my own.
